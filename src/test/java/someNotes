1 =i used those dependencys
        testng
        webdrivermanager
        selenium-java
2 =i used page object model to centralize the locators and increase the usability

3 =i put all data inside boxes by using send keys method i konow its not a good practice but since its only for the
registration senario i thing it should be okey
(if needed i can use data provider or using Apachi po dependency to achive data driven testing or i can use configuration file as well  )
4 =i have some basic utilities
        configurations reader
        driver utill
        BaseClass =i used  @before and  @after method inside my base class
  i design  my driver util as  singleton  so i wont have any conflict to call drivers always it will be onl one driver
  i create my configuration reader to read data from configuration file

5 i create configuration file and i store my url and browser  type over there

    if you have any questions please let me know most probably i have answer for it   thanks
